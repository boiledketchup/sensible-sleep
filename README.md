# Sensible Sleep
Sensible sleep is a mod for Forge 1.18.2 made with MCreator aiming to make sleep more, well, sensible.
## Features:
In dangerous locations, monsters will wake you in the middle of the night(1) if you are in a dangerous location(2), villagers will kick you out of their beds(1)(3), and if you slept an dangerous location(2) but no monsters where found nearby, you'll just wake up with a debuff.
Also adds a new helmet enchantment, Hypersomnia, which makes you sleep well anywhere. (Never wake up with debuffs or get awoken by anything)
(1): If players connected to server = 1
(2): Bed location has light level less than 11 and access to the sky
(3): If you don't have Hero Of The Village effect applied
